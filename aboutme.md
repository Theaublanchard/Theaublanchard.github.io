Hello ! I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics and Machine Learning. I am working at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) in [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) supervised by [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/), [Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/) and [Matthieu Geist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ectPLEUAAAAJ&hl=fr). I am also part of the [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) Paris team [HeKA](https://team.inria.fr/heka/) focused on Health data and model-driven Knowledge Acquisition. Before this, I was a Master student in Mathematics and Machine Learning at [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) in [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

I am interested in systems at the intersection of mathematics and computation, in having analytical insights on real-world applications, especially in problem related to healthcare.
My current PhD  subject is focused on application of **Reinforcement Learning** for optimisation of medical trajectory to avoid diagnostic wandering in rare diseases. I have a great interest in:
- **Robust and Risk-Averse Reinforcement Learning,** 
- **Theory of LLMs**
- **Bandit theory**

News : 

04/2024 : 2 papers accepted, one at ICML 2024 on [Bandit with Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10167) and one on theory of [Robust MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05372) at UAI 2024 !

01/2024 : I will be a visiting researcher in the [California Institut of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) in the group of Professor [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Eric Mazumdar](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mazumdar/) working on Robust RL ! 

11/2023 : I am organizing with [Neurips in Paris 2023](https://neuripsinparis.github.io/neurips2023paris/) with [Linus Bleistein](https://linusbleistein.github.io/) among other colleagues on the 6th and 7th of December 2023 at Sorbonne Université (Paris 5). A great occasion to meet and discuss recent advances in ML in central Paris !
