Hello !  I'm currently a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics, working at PariSantéCampus, Beaujon Hopital, and GE Healthcare. I'm supervised both supervised by [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) and Valérie Vilgrain. I am also tutored by Vincent Morard at GEHC and Jules Grégory at Beaujon. I am also part of the [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) Paris team [HeKA](https://team.inria.fr/heka/) focused on Health data and model-driven Knowledge Acquisition. Before this, I was a Master student in Mathematics and Machine Learning at [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) in [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). I also completed my engineering degree at [Télécom Paris] (https://telecom-paris.fr) with a specialisation in Image and Signal processing.

My PhD subject is focused on trying to incorporate multimodal data in self-supervised learning framework. The applications are strongly focused on biomedical imaging. Moreover, I have a great interest currently in :
- **Small scale SSL**
- **Riemannian Metric learning**
- **Conditionnal Data Augmentation**
