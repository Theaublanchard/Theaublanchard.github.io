Hello ! I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics and Machine Learning. I am working at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) in [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) supervised by [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) and [Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/). I am also part of the [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) Paris team [HeKA](https://team.inria.fr/heka/) focused on Health data and model-driven Knowledge Acquisition. Before this, I was a Master student in Mathematics and Machine Learning at [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) in [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

I am interested in systems at the intersection of mathematics and computation, in having analytical insights on real-world applications, especially in problem related to healthcare.
My current PhD  subject is focused on application of **Reinforcement Learning** for optimisation of medical trajectory to avoid diagnostic wandering in rare diseases. I have a great interest in:
- **Robust and Risk-Averse Reinforcement Learning,** ( with Matthieu Geist at Google DeepMind)
- **Bandit theory (Thomson Sampling),** (with Tom Huix and Alain Durmus at Ecole Polytechnique)  
- **Sampling methods in large dimention.**

News : I will be a visiting researcher in the [California Institut of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) in the group of Professor [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Eric Mazumdar](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mazumdar/) working on Robust RL ! 


I am organizing with [Neurips in Paris 2023](https://neuripsinparis.github.io/neurips2023paris/) with [Linus Bleistein](https://linusbleistein.github.io/) among other colleagues on the 6th and 7th of December 2023 at Sorbonne Université (Paris 5). A great occasion to meet and discuss recent advances in ML in central Paris !

I have also co-funded a [junior seminar](https://seminairedoctorantcrc.github.io/aboutme/) at [PariSanté Campus](https://parisantecampus.fr/) with ealing with interactions between mathematics, Machine Learning and healthcare. Don't hesite to contact me if you want participate or present your work !
